# Using workspaces to develop the GitLab UI

GitLab team members can use [GitLab Workspaces](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/workspace/)
to develop the GitLab UI. Follow these instructions to create a new Workspace:

1. Open the [GitLab UI's project page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui).
1. In the Git revision dropdown, select the branch you want to work on.
1. Select the "Edit" button. In the dropdown, select the "New workspace" button.
1. You'll be redirected to the "New Workspace" form.
1. Select the "Create Workspace" button.
1. Once the Workspace has been created, you can open it in VSCode for the Web.
1. Once you are in the Workspace for the first time, a VSCode task will install `asdf` dependencies
   and `npm` dependencies. It will take a few minutes to complete.
1. Start developing on Workspaces!
